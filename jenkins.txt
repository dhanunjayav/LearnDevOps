Start the Jenkins service and set it to run at boot time:

sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
sudo systemctl enable jenkins.service
In order to allow visitors access to Jenkins, you need to allow inbound traffic on port 8080:

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Now, test Jenkins by visiting the following address from your web browser:

http://<your-Vultr-server-IP>:8080
